[This is some help for building with experimental S3 support.]


--- BUILDING

module load openmpi-gnu

./bootstrap


# configure must be able to find libaws4c, libxml2, libcurl, libcrypto, etc.
# On some machines, the libxml2 include files are in:
#
#     /usr/include/libxml2
#
# which is not a standard include location, so we must define CPPFLAGS
# to put that path in the include path. Do this:
#
#     setenv CPPFLAGS -I/usr/include/libxml2
#     [or add "CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2" to the end of the configure command]
#
# Use the --with-aws4c=DIR to point to the path where your libaws4c library
# sits.
#
# Use the --prefix=iorInstallDir to point to the path where you want IOR
# to install all the files it builds during the "make" process.

./configure --prefix=iorInstallDir --with-S3 [ --with-aws4c=DIR ]


# Here is an example configure-command invocation, for building with the
# S3-targeting extensions, which require access to additional libraries
# mentioned above.  This will probably not work verbatim on your
# installation, because libraries will be installed in different locations,
# but it could help you to understand what is needed.

./configure --prefix=`pwd`/installed \
            --with-S3 \
            --with-aws4c=`pwd`/aws4c \
            LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib64 -L`pwd`/libxml2-2.9.1/installed/lib" \
            CFLAGS="-I`pwd`/libxml2-2.9.1/installed/include/libxml2"


# 14-May-2015:
# To change the target of the experiment, there is an #if block from line
# 284-309. The "if" portion is activated by putting a 1 as the argument
# instead of a 0. In that case, the experiment will use the four ECS nodes
# directly, splitting the load up between all four.
#
# If the #if argument is 0, then the "#else" portion is executed. In this
# case you can use the load balancer, haproxy.ccstar.lanl.gov, by using
# the IP 10.143.0.1:80. If you want to use one of the ECS nodes directly
# us the IP 10.140.0.[15-17]:9020.
#
# To specify the bucket where the experiment file(s) will go, you need
# to set that with the "const char* bucket_name declaration. There are
# a couple options at lines 207-208.
